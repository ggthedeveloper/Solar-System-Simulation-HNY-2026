Solar System – Happy New Year 2026

A visually rich, interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript Solar System simulation celebrating Earth’s real revolution around the Sun and welcoming New Year 2026.
The project combines orbital mechanics inspiration, parallax effects, background music, and responsive design into a single self-contained web experience.

✨ Features

☀️ Realistic Solar System Layout

Sun at the center with 8 planets

Relative orbit distances and speeds based on real orbital periods

Moon orbiting Earth

🌀 Smooth Orbital Animations

CSS-based rotations with adjustable speed

Each planet’s orbit speed scales proportionally

🎛 Interactive Controls

Orbit speed controller

Background music play/pause

Volume control

🧭 3D Parallax Effect

Mouse movement rotates the scene in 3D space

Adds depth and realism

🎉 New Year Celebration Message

Triggered when Earth completes one full revolution

Animated celebratory message

📱 Fully Responsive

Scales perfectly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens

🎶 Background Space Music

Ambient looping audio for immersion

🛠 Technologies Used

🎮 Controls Guide
Control	Description
⏱ Speed Slider	Adjusts orbital speed of all planets
🎵 Play / Pause	Toggles background music
🔊 Volume Slider	Controls music volume
🖱 Mouse Move	Rotates the solar system in 3D
🌍 Educational Note

Planet speeds are scaled proportionally using real orbital periods (Mercury → Neptune).
This provides a visually accurate relative motion while remaining aesthetically pleasing.

🧠 Customization Ideas

Add asteroid belt

Include planet labels

Add zoom controls

Replace music with your own audio

Add touch controls for mobile

Convert to Three.js for true 3D rendering
